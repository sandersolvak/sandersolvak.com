				<h2>Personally</h2>
				<p>Born in 1980, I grew up in a small rural village in central Estonia, riding my bike, breaking and making things and drawing. After high-school I studied sociology at the <a href="http://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a> for a few years before getting seriously into design.</p>
				<p>On most days you'd find me in a good mood, looking at the bright side and trying to find a joke in every situation. I enjoy coffee, music, good books and good food. I always love <a href="http://blog.sandersolvak.com/tagged/film/">a good movie</a> and occasionally some that are generally considered <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100531/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">rather bad</a>.</p>
				<p>Photography has always been my main hobby, ever since I got my hands on my dads old  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit_(camera)#Zenit-E_line">Zenit E</a>. My main camera these days is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_d700">Nikon D700</a> and whenever it strikes my fancy, the fun little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Trip_35">Olympus Trip35</a>. You can have a look at my more artistically ambitious pictures <a href="photo.html">here</a> and casual everyday snaps on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sandersolvak/">flickr</a>.</p>

				<h2>Professionally</h2>
				<p>After a couple of years of freelancing making websites and party flyers, I was hired by Videobet, a subsidiary of Playtech, to design all things print related. The team was small and wearing multiple hats was a given, so I got deeper into UI design, a field I now care a lot about.</p>
				<p>I've been working at Videobet more than eight years now, creating dozens of posters and flyers for games, working on trade-show stand designs, <a href="playtech_web.html">websites</a>, <a href="videobet_brochure.html">booklets</a> and <a href="playtech_brochure.html">brochures</a>, developing user interfaces, as well as all kinds of marketing collateral and taking care of in-house design jobs.</p>
				<p>Over the years I've been taking on freelance projects as a way to keep things more varied and fun. I enjoy working on web sites, big or small and treat each new project as a chance to learn something new. I've been lucky to have roughly half of my freelance web projects needing some extent of identity design as well. A selection of what I've made can be seen in the <a href="work.html">work</a> section of this site.</p>
				<p>I believe in keeping things clean and simple, love finding elegant solutions to problems and try to leave things better than I found them.</p>

				<h2><a name="contact">Get in touch</a></h2>
				<p>I'm always eager to hear about interesting projects. If you think I can help you with yours, the surest way to get in touch with me is to e-mail me at:<br /> <strong>sander {at} sandersolvak.com</strong></p>
				<p>I'm not much into social networks but you can find me on twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/sandersolvak">@sandersolvak</a> where I mostly observe, but occasionally, well, tweet.</p>
				
				<h2>About this site</h2>
				<p>As an online home, I designed and built this site myself using html5 and responsive web design techniques in part to teach myself and in part to just do things the right way. It's completely static and currently doesn't even have a cms, aside from the <a href="http://blog.sandersolvak.com">blog</a> part which runs on tumblr.</p>
				<p><strong>Thanks for stopping by!</strong></p>
